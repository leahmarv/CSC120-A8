Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I would tell someone taking this course in the future that it's helpful to write out all the methods you'll be using, what they do, and the variables you'll use on paper before you start to code. It gave me a good outline to start off of so that I wasn't coding with only a blank screen in front of me.
