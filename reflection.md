Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My class represents the protagonist of a game (the Player). They have an inventory, are traveling in a certain direction, and are located at certain x and y coordinates. The Player class also records the number of turns that a player has taken and the action that is taken during each turn. The user can undo the Player's last action. The Player class could be used with the instructions for a game in Main to allow a simple game where a player moves around a map and interacts with their environment.

I did not implement any additional methods because it did not seem necessary for my purposes. However, I did implement additional variables other than the parameters for these methods. These additional variables include an ArrayList of moves and a counter that keeps track of the number of turns the Player has taken.

I would tell someone taking this course in the future that it's helpful to write out all the methods you'll be using, what they do, and the variables you'll use on paper before you start to code. It gave me a good outline to start off of so that I wasn't coding with only a blank screen in front of me.
